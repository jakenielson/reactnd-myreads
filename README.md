# MyReads Project

This is my MyReads project for the Udacity React Nanodegree program. It was built with Create React App along with a BooksAPI provided by Udacity.

This app allows the user to search for books and place them on bookshelves.

## To Build and Run

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
